    <p class="mb-4 leading-8">
      A resume is a summary of your work profile, combined with your most recent achievements and skills. A well-written
      resume is a one or two page document that states your relevant skills and work experience. Your resume puts
      forward your most important skills and accomplishments to inform the HR manager that you are the right candidate
      for the role.
      Resumes also offer an effective way for you to assess your career trajectory and skills to make suitable
      adjustments or additions to them as per the demand in the industry. It is your first impression to the recruiter
      and helps them decide whether to invite you to interview. Writing a strong resume typically requires planning and
      understanding what the hiring managers are looking for, as it can be difficult to detail every single aspect of
      your work experience within one or two pages.</p>
